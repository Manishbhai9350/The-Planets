## The Planets 

This Three.js-powered experience features four distinct planets — Earth, Venus, Csilla, and Volcanic — each with unique visuals and animations. The core features of the project include:

🪐 Key Features:
Self-Rotation: Each planet rotates continuously on its own axis, simulating real planetary behavior.

Orbital Motion: All planets revolve in a circular orbit around a central point, giving a dynamic feel of a solar system.

Scroll Interaction: Using the mouse wheel, users can control the speed and direction of the orbital rotation, making the system interactive and engaging.

Keyboard Navigation: Users can also navigate the system using left and right arrow keys, enabling intuitive control over the planets' revolution.
